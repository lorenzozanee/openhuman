//! Host-authored turns on an existing conversation thread.
//!
//! Background-delivery notices and goal continuations are turns the *host*
//! injects into a user's thread. They must run on the thread's own session —
//! the cached agent, or one cold-boot resumed from the thread's transcript —
//! for two reasons:
//!
//! * the model needs the conversation to present a delegated result in
//!   context ("here's the inbox summary you asked for", not "what are we doing
//!   with the inbox?"), and
//! * the turn must land in the thread's durable transcript. A throwaway
//!   `OpenHumanSessionHost` bound to the thread wrote a competing root
//!   transcript with a newer `created`, and the next cold-boot resume picked
//!   that one — three rows — over the real history, so after a restart the
//!   agent had forgotten everything but the delivery notice.
